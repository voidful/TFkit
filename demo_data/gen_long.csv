"Looking good , feeling good Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad , fashion was actually in my blood . I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd . I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old . A friend 's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker . In high school I started making my own clothes , mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it . During the last two years of school , I worked part - time for a small business that made hand - painted silk clothing and bags . The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place . Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting . From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started . For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand - made and one - of - a - kind , specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me . Every morning I jumped out of bed , went to my studio and worked on my projects . This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work . And at night I even dreamed of new designs ! Fashion design is _ art . What I mean is that it 's something close to you and something you can touch and feel , and actually interact with . My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on , such as sewing and pattern - making . Even if you end up specializing , it 's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high - quality clothes . Also , if you dream of having your own clothing line , the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes . You have to try and do this because that 's the way you 're going to develop something that 's all yours and unlike anyone else 's . I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence . [SEP] What advice does the author give to those who want to be fashion designers ?
